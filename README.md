## Overview

![Screen shot](images/screenshot-desktop.png)

The challenge was to replicate the [design](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) as close as possible.
Although the challenge was relatively easy, I used it to learn:
- How to organise my scss files in folders.
- I also tried using PostCSS and the plugins tp get a good feel of them later.
- Learning how to use PostCSS made me learn gulp. Now I can create basic gulp tasks.

### Built With
